This project will be to explore the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset (relatively small). I am most interested in whether or not a synopsis/plot of a movie can determine what the ratings are and how profitable it was. Furthermore I want to explore whether a cast/director can determine whether or not a movie will do well more than the plot. In other words, do people come for the story or because people want to see their favorite actors/directors works?
